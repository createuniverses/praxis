Key OO Characteristics</font></font></b>
<h3>
<b><i><font face="Arial">Object</font></i></b></h3>
<a NAME="object-def"></a><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>"A package
of information and descriptions of its manipulation"</b> [<a href="#robson">Robson</a>]</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Objects separate interface from implementation,
"what" is wanted (on the outside) from "how" it is accomplished (on the
inside). This idea of hiding the data inside a package with a fixed set
of allowed manipulations is called encapsulation. Why? If the object always
selects how to perform a requested manipulation, you guarantee that the
procedure and the data it operates on always match.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A <b>message</b> denotes an operation
that can be performed on an <b>object</b>. The code that describes how
to perform an operation on a specific object type is called a <b>method</b>.
From the outside, objects receive messages. On the inside, these messages
are mapped to methods that perform appropriate actions for the specific
kind of object. An object’s <b>interface</b> is the set of messages to
which it can respond. For example, several object types may have a "dump"
method to cause the object to display its state. Each kind of object will
need a unique method to accomplish this. So the message-method idea separates
the interface from the implementation. The idea that different kinds of
objects might invoke different methods to respond to the same message is
called <b>polymorphism</b>. Methods can be bound to messages as soon as
the type of the object receiving the message is known (called <b>early
binding</b>), or this mapping can wait until run-time (<b>late binding</b>).</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Some languages (notably C++) make
a syntactic distinction between early and late binding of methods to messages
(virtual functions are bound late, while all others are bound early – at
link time). Smalltalk makes no such distinction. The C++ approach has potentially
dangerous consequences when you manipulate an object through a pointer
to its parent class. If a method of the superclass is virtual, you get
late binding to the appropriate function for the object’s class. On the
other hand, if that method is not virtual, you get early binding to the
parent class’s definition even if the child class has overridden it. Smalltalk
adheres rigorously to the idea that the object itself has sole ownership
of the mapping from methods to messages.</font>

<h3>
<b><i><font face="Arial">Class</font></i></b></h3>
<a NAME="class-def"></a><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"A description
of one or more similar objects"</font></b> [<a href="#robson">Robson</a>]
<p><a NAME="instance-def"></a>A specific object described by a particular
class is called an <b>instance</b> of the class.
<br>(Example: Dog is a class; Poodle is a subclass of Dog; FiFi is an object,
an instance of Poodle).
<br>A class is a kind of object that describes the behaviors (methods)
of its instances, and whose methods provide for creation, initialization,
and destruction of an instance. All instances of a particular class use
the same method to respond to a given message. Classes may define other
members that are shared by all instances of the class. These are called
class variables. (In C++, these would be static members.)

<h3>
<b><i><font face="Arial">Inheritance</font></i></b></h3>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">A means for creating a new object or
class using an existing one as a starting place and defining only what
changes. C++ only supports class-based inheritance, but some systems also
allow objects to inherit directly from other objects. At minimum, inheritance
requires that the child class override its parent’s name. In addition,
a child class can:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">add instance variables</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">add class variables</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">define methods for new messages</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">provide methods for (<b>override</b>)
messages already handled by the parent class</font></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>What C++ Does for you…</font></font></b></h3>
<b><i><font face="Arial">Name mangling – separation of name spaces</font></i></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This mechanism – decorating symbol
names with extra characters that uniquely identify their class and prototype
– is the traditional C++ method for operator overloading, method overloading,
and namespace separation. C provides a much smaller set of namespaces than
C++ requires, so this strategy allowed C++ to be implemented as a preprocessor
for C compilers originally.</font>
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">Rigorous type checking</font></i></b>
<p>Because of the function prototype requirement and name mangling, a C++
compiler can provide strict type checking for method invocations.
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">Automatic lifetime control</font></i></b>
<p>Guarantees constructor call upon creation and destructor call upon deletion
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">Multiple Storage classes (same as C)</font></i></b>
<p>Automatic, static, dynamically allocated
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">Typed dynamic memory management</font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">Default constructor, destructor, copy constructor,
and assignment operator</font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">Explicit early and late binding support</font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">And more…</font></i></b>

<h3>
<b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>What other OO languages do (or don’t
do)</font></font></b></h3>
Just to make sure we don’t get caught in a C++ centered view of the world,
here are some ways other OO systems differ.
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">Run-time type identification</font></i></b>
<p>This is a Big Deal in C++, but it’s relatively trivial in an interpreted
language to know the type of a reference at run-time.
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">Metaclasses</font></i></b>
<p>Classes are objects, too (Smalltalk, Java?)
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">Garbage collection</font></i></b>
<p>Java and smalltalk both manage memory for you, freeing objects when
they go out of scope or are no longer referenced anywhere.
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">Single Inheritance only</font></i></b>
<p>Java, Smalltalk 80
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">Everything is an object</font></i></b>
<p>Smalltalk
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">Operator overloading</font></i></b>
<p>Smalltalk makes no distinction between operators and other kinds of
messages. The message syntax is flexible enough that you can define operators
in the same way as any other kind of message.
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">Visibility control</font></i></b>
<p>Smalltalk 80 does not appear to provide options for visibility control
(based on my quick survey). Instance variables are always private, methods
are always public as far as I can tell.
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">Pointers</font></i></b>
<p>Not in Smalltalk, Java: Both languages deal with objects through implicit
references. It is still possible to create data structures, but the language
hides much of the memory management work.
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">No Casting</font></i></b>
<p>As far as I can tell, smalltalk has no equivalent of a C/C++ cast.
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">Late binding</font></i></b>
<p>Smalltalk makes no syntactic distinction between late and early bound
methods (unlike C++ "virtual" methods)

construct and destruct), classes, inheritance, polymorphism</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Not covered: multiple inheritance,
automatic initialization / destruction,</font>
<h3>
<b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Strategy 1: message maps and aggregation</font></font></b></h3>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Class: a struct with a pointer to a
method table (message map). Contructor and destuctor are really initializer
and destructor, and are invoked manually at beginning and end of lifetime.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Messages and methods: mapping table
(first cut: use macros like MFC to create a mapping between messages and
methods). Alternative: message map can be built at run-time (hash, tree,
linked list) – method resolution may be slower.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Inheritance: aggregate the parent
struct (recursively) at the beginning of the derived one, link the child
method table to the parent and search recursively to resolve messages to
methods</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Pros and cons:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times">+ flexible and minimal manual
steps required</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">+ relatively simple – no need to
write a preprocessor!</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">- all methods are late bound, run-time
penalty</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&shy; defeats compile time type
checking, may require a single prototype for all methods</font></blockquote>

<h1><a name="whatis">What is Ficl?</a></h1>
Ficl is a complete programming language interpreter designed to be
embedded into other systems (including firmware based ones) as a
command, macro, and development prototype language. Unlike other
scripting interpreters, Ficl:

<ul>

<li>
typically takes under 2 hours to port to a new system&mdash;much
less if the target operating system is one of several already supported
(Win32, Linux, FreeBSD, RiscOS, and more)

<li>
has a small memory footprint: a fully featured Win32 console
version takes less than 100K of memory, and a minimal version is less
than half that

<li>
is relatively quick thanks to its "switch-threaded" virtual
machine design and just in time compiling

<li>
is a complete and powerful programming language

<li>
is interactive

<li>
has object oriented programming features that can be used to wrap
data structures or classes of the host system without altering them&#151;even
if the host is mainly written in a non-OO language

</ul>

<p>

Ficl syntax is based on ANS Forth and the code is ANSI C.  See
below for examples of <a href="#includesficl">software and products
that include ficl</a>. Ficl stands for "Forth inspired command language".


<h3>Ficl Versus Other Forth Interpreters</h3>

Where most Forths view themselves as the center of the system and
expect the rest of the system to be coded in Forth, Ficl acts as a
component of the system.  It is easy to export code written in C or
ASM to Ficl in the style of TCL, or to invoke Ficl code from a compiled
module. This allows you to do incremental development in a way that
combines the best features of threaded languages (rapid
development, quick code/test/debug cycle, reasonably fast) with the best
features of C (everyone knows it, easier to support large blocks of
code, efficient, type checking).  In addition, Ficl provides a simple
and powerful object model that can act as an object oriented <i>adapter</i>
for code written in C (or asm, Forth, C++...).


<h3>Ficl Design Goals</h3>
<ul>

<li>
Target 32- and 64-bit processors

<li>
Scripting, prototyping, and extension language for systems
written also in C

<li>
Supportable&mdash;code is as transparent as I can make it

<li>
Interface to functions written in C

<li>
Conformant to the 1994 ANSI Standard for Forth (DPANS94)

<li>
Minimize porting effort&mdash;require an ANSI C runtime environment
and minimal glue code

<li>
Provide object oriented extensions

</ul>

<h2><a name="features">Ficl Features</a></h2>

<ul>

<li>
Simple to integrate into existing systems: the sample
implementation requires three Ficl function calls (see the example
program in <b>main.c</b>).

<li>
Written in ANSI C for portability.

<li>
Standard: Implements the ANS Forth CORE word set, part of the
CORE EXT word set, SEARCH and SEARCH EXT, TOOLS and part of TOOLS EXT,
LOCAL and LOCAL EXT, EXCEPTION, MEMORY, and various extras.

<li>
Extensible: you can export code written in Forth, C, or ASM in a
straightforward way.  Ficl provides open facilities for extending the
language in an application specific way. You can even add new
control structures (not surprising if you're familiar with Forth)

<li>
Ficl and C/C++ can interact in two ways: Ficl can wrap C code,
and C functions can invoke Ficl code.

<li>
Ficl code is thread safe and re-entrant: your program can have one or more
Ficl "systems", and each "system" can have one or Ficl virtual machines.
Each Ficl virtual machine has an otherwise complete state, and each can
be bound to a separate I/O channel (or none at all).
An optional function called ficlLockDictionary() can control
exclusive dictionary access. This function is stubbed out by
default (See FICL_MULTITHREAD in sysdep.h). As long as there is only
one "session" that can compile words into the dictionary, you do not
need exclusive dictionary access for multithreading.
<b>Note</b>:
while the code is re-entrant, there are still restrictions on how you
can use it safely in a multithreaded system. Specifically, the VM
itself maintains state, so you generally need a VM per thread in a
multithreaded system. If interrupt service routines make calls into Ficl
code that alters VM state, then these generally need their
own VM as well. Alternatively, you could provide a mutual exclusion
mechanism to serialize access to a VM from multiple threads.

<li>
ROMable: Ficl is designed to work in RAM based and ROM code / RAM
data environments. It does require somewhat more memory than a pure ROM
implementation because it builds its system dictionary in RAM
at startup time.

<li>
Written in ANSI C to be as simple as I can make it to understand,
support, debug, and port. Compiles without complaint at <code>/Az /W4</code> (require
ANSI C, max. warnings) under Microsoft Visual C++, and <code>-ansi</code>
under GCC. Ports to several other toolchains and operating systems
(notably FreeBSD and Linux flavors) exist.

<li> Does full 32 bit math (but you need to implement two mixed
precision math primitives (see sysdep.c)) </li>

</ul>

<hr>

<h2><a name="porting">Porting Ficl</a></h2>

To install Ficl on your target system, you need an ANSI C compiler and
its runtime library.  Inspect the system dependent macros and functions
in <b>sysdep.h</tt> and <tt>sysdep.c</tt> and edit them to suit
your system. For example, <tt>INT16</tt> is a <tt>short</tt> on some
compilers and an <tt>int</tt> on others. Check the default <tt>CELL</tt>
alignment controlled by <tt> FICL_ALIGN</tt>. If necessary, add new
definitions of <tt>ficlMalloc, ficlFree, ficlRealloc</tt>, and <tt>ficlTextOut</tt>
to work with your operating system. Finally, use <tt>testmain.c</tt> as
a guide to installing the ficl system and one or more virtual machines
into your code. You do not need to include <tt>testmain.c</tt> in your
build.
<p>
Note: ficlLockDictionary can be left unimplemented in most
multithreaded implementations - it's only necessary if you expect to
have more than one thread modifying the dictionary at the same
time. If you do decide to implement it, make sure calls to
ficlLockDictionary can nest properly (see the comments in sysdep.h). You
need to keep count of nested locks and unlocks and do the right
thing.
<p>

Feel free to stub out the double precision math functions (which are
presently implemented as inline assembly because it's so easy on many 32
bit processors) with kludge code that only goes to 32 bit
precision. In most applications, you won't notice the difference. If
you're doing a lot of number crunching, consider implementing them
correctly.


<h3>Build Controls</h3>

The file sysdep.h contains default values for build controls. Most of
these are written such that if you define them on the compiler command
line, the defaults are overridden. I suggest you take the defaults
on everything below the "build controls" section until you're confident
of your port. Beware of declaring too small a dictionary, for example.
You need about 3200 cells for a full system, about 2000 if you
strip out most of the "soft" words.

<h3>Softcore</h3>
Many words from all the supported wordsets are written in Forth, and
stored as a big string that Ficl compiles when it starts. The sources
for all of these words are in directory <b>softcore</b>. There is a
.bat file (softcore.bat) and a PERL 5 script (softcore.pl) that convert
Forth files into the file softcore.c, so softcore.c is really dependent
on the Forth sources.  This is not reflected in the Visual C++ project
database.  For the time being, it's a manual step.  You can edit
<b>make.bat</b> to change the list of files that contribute to
<b>softcore.c</b>.

<h3>To-Do List (target system dependent words)</h3>

<ul>

<li>
Unimplemented system dependent <tt>CORE</tt> word: <tt>KEY</tt>
(implement this yourself if you need it)

<li>
Kludged <tt>CORE</tt> word: <tt>ACCEPT</tt> (implement this
better if you need to)

</ul>

<h2><a name="api">Application Programming Interface</a></h2>

The following is a partial listing of functions that interface your
system or program to Ficl. For a complete listing, see <b>ficl.h</b>
(which is heavily commented).  For examples, see <b>main.c</b> and the
FiclWin sources (<a href="#download">below</a>).

<dl>
  <dt> <b>FICL_SYSTEM *ficlInitSystem(int nDictCells)</b> </dt>
  <dd> Initializes Ficl's shared system data structures, and creates the
dictionary allocating the specified number of CELLs from the heap (by a
call to ficlMalloc) </dd>
  <dt> <b>void ficlTermSystem(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys)</b> </dt>
  <dd> Reclaims memory allocated for the ficl system including all
dictionaries and all virtual machines created by vmCreate. Any uses of
the memory allocation words (allocate and resize) are your
problem. </dd>
  <dt> <b>int ficlBuild(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys, char *name, FICL_CODE code,
char flags)</b> </dt>
  <dd> Create a primitive word in ficl's main dictionary with the given
name, code pointer, and properties (immediate, compile only, etc) as
described by the flags (see ficl.h for flag           descriptions of
the form FW_XXXX) </dd>
  <dt> <b>int ficlExec(FICL_VM *pVM, char *text)</b> </dt>
  <dd> Feed the specified C string ('\0' terminated) to the given
virtual machine for evaluation. Returns various exception codes (VM_XXXX
in ficl.h) to indicate the reason for returning. Normal exit
condition is VM_OUTOFTEXT, indicating that the VM consumed the string
successfully and is back for more. ficlExec calls can be nested, and
the function itself is re-entrant, but note           that a VM is
static, so you have to take reasonable precautions (for example, use one
VM per thread in a multithreaded system if you want multiple threads to
be able to execute commands). </dd>
  <dt> <b>int ficlExecC(FICL_VM *pVM, char *text, int nChars)</b> </dt>
  <dd> Same as ficlExec, but takes a count indicating the length of the
supplied string. Setting nChars to -1 is equivalent to ficlExec (expects
'\0' termination). </dd>
  <dt> <b>int ficlExecXT(FICL_VM *pVM, FICL_WORD *pFW)</b> </dt>
  <dd> Same as ficlExec, but takes a pointer to a FICL_WORD instead of a
string. Executes the word and returns after it has finished. If
executing the word results in an exception, this function will
re-throw the same code if it is nested under another ficlExec family
function, or return the exception code directly if not. This function
is useful if you need to execute the same           word repeatedly -
you save the dictionary search and outer interpreter overhead. </dd>
  <dt> <b>void ficlFreeVM(FICL_VM *pVM)</b> </dt>
  <dd> Removes the VM in question from the system VM list and deletes
the&nbsp; memory allocated to it. This is an optional call, since
ficlTermSystem will do this cleanup for you. This function           is
handy if you're going to do a lot of dynamic creation of VMs. </dd>
  <dt> <b>FICL_VM *ficlNewVM(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys)</b> </dt>
  <dd> Create, initialize, and return a VM from the heap using
ficlMalloc. Links the VM into the system VM list for later reclamation
by ficlTermSystem. </dd>
  <dt> <b>FICL_WORD *ficlLookup(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys, char *name)</b> </dt>
  <dd> Returns the address (also known as an XT in this case) of the
specified word in the main dictionary. If not found, returns NULL. The
address can be used in a call to ficlExecXT. </dd>
  <dt> <b>FICL_DICT *ficlGetDict(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys)</b> </dt>
  <dd> Returns a pointer to the main system dictionary, or NULL if the
system is uninitialized. </dd>
  <dt> <b>FICL_DICT *ficlGetEnv(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys)</b> </dt>
  <dd> Returns a pointer to the environment dictionary. This dictionary
stores information that describes this implementation as required by the
Standard. </dd>
  <dt> <b>void ficlSetEnv(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys, char *name, UNS32 value)</b> </dt>
  <dd> Enters a new constant into the environment dictionary, with the
specified name and value. </dd>
  <dt> <b>void ficlSetEnvD(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys, char *name, UNS32 hi,
UNS32 lo)</b> </dt>
  <dd> Enters a new double-cell constant into the environment dictionary
with the specified name and value. </dd>
  <dt> <b>FICL_DICT *ficlGetLoc(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys)</b> </dt>
  <dd> Returns a pointer to the locals dictionary. This function is
defined only if FICL_WANT_LOCALS is #defined as non-zero (see sysdep.h).
The locals dictionary is the symbol table for <a href="ficl_loc.html">local
variables</a>. </dd>
  <dt> <b>void ficlCompileCore(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys)</b> </dt>
  <dd> Defined in words.c, this function builds ficl's primitives.&nbsp;
 </dd>
  <dt> <b>void ficlCompileSoftCore(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys)</b> </dt>
  <dd> Defined in softcore.c, this function builds ANS required words
and ficl extras by evaluating a text string (think of it as a memory
mapped file ;-) ). The string itself is built from files           in
the softwords directory by PERL script softcore.pl.&nbsp; </dd>

<h2> <a name="extras"></a>Ficl extras </h2>
<h3> <a name="exnumber"></a>Number syntax </h3>
You can precede a number with "0x", as in C, and it will be interpreted
as a hex value regardless of the value of <code>BASE</code>. Likewise,
numbers prefixed with "0d" will be interpreted as       decimal values.
Example:
<pre>ok&gt; decimal 123 . cr<br>123<br>ok&gt; 0x123 . cr<br>291<br>ok&gt; 0x123 x. cr<br>123<br></pre>
Note: ficl2.05 and later - this behavior is controlled by the <a
 href="ficl_parse.html">prefix parser</a> defined in <code>prefix.c</code>.
You can add other prefixes by defining handlers for       them in ficl
or C.
<h3> <a name="exsearch"></a> The <code>SEARCH</code> wordset and Ficl
extensions </h3>
<p> Ficl implements many of the search order words in terms of two
primitives called <code><a href="#tosearch">&gt;SEARCH</a></code> and <code><a
 href="#searchfrom">SEARCH&gt;</a></code>. As         their names
suggest (assuming you're familiar with Forth), they push and pop the
search order stack. </p>
<p> The standard does not appear to specify any conditions under which
the search order is reset to a sane state. Ficl resets the search order
to its default state whenever <tt>ABORT</tt> happens. This includes
stack underflows and overflows. <tt>QUIT</tt> does not affect the search
order. The minimum search order (set by <tt>ONLY</tt>) is equivalent
to </p>
<pre>FORTH-WORDLIST 1 SET-ORDER<br></pre>
<p> There is a default maximum of 16 wordlists in the search order. This
can be changed by redefining FICL_DEFAULT_VOCS (declared in sysdep.h). </p>
<p> <b>Note</b>: Ficl resets the search order whenever it does <tt>ABORT</tt>.
If you don't like this behavior, just comment out the
dictResetSearchOrder() lines in ficlExec(). </p>
<dl>
  <dt> <a name="tosearch"></a><code>&gt;search ( wid -- )</code> </dt>
  <dd> Push <tt>wid</tt> onto the search order. Many of the other search
order words are written in terms of the <tt>SEARCH&gt;</tt> and <tt>&gt;SEARCH</tt>
primitives. This word can be defined in           ANS Forth as follows </dd>
  <dd> <tt>: &gt;search&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;r get-order 1+ r&gt; swap
set-order ;</tt> </dd>
  <dt> <a name="searchfrom"></a><tt>search&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( -- wid )</tt> </dt>
  <dd> Pop <tt>wid</tt> off the search order (can be coded in ANS Forth
as&nbsp;<tt>: search&gt;&nbsp; get-order nip 1- set-order ;</tt> ) </dd>
  <dt> <a name="ficlsetcurrent"></a><tt>ficl-set-current&nbsp;&nbsp; (
wid -- old-wid )</tt> </dt>
  <dd> Set wid as compile wordlist, leaving the previous compile
wordlist on the stack </dd>
  <dt> <a name="ficlvocabulary"></a><tt>ficl-vocabulary&nbsp;&nbsp; (
nBins "name" -- )</tt> </dt>
  <dd> Creates a <tt>ficl-wordlist</tt> with the specified number of
hash table bins, binds it to the name, and associates the semantics of <tt>vocabulary</tt>
with it (replaces the top wid in the           search order list with
its own wid when executed) </dd>
  <dt> <a name="ficlwordlist"></a><tt>ficl-wordlist&nbsp;&nbsp; ( nBins
-- wid )</tt> </dt>
  <dd> Creates a wordlist with the specified number of hash table bins,
and leaves the address of the wordlist on the stack. A <tt>ficl-wordlist</tt>
behaves exactly as a regular wordlist, but it           may search
faster depending on the number of bins chosen and the number of words it
contains at search time. As implemented in ficl, a wordlist is single
threaded by default. <tt> ficl-named-wordlist</tt> takes a name for the
wordlist and creates a word that pushes the <tt>wid</tt>. This is by
contrast to <tt>VOCABULARY</tt>, which also has a name, but replaces
the           top of the search order with its <tt>wid</tt>. </dd>
  <dt> <a name="ficlforgetwid"></a><tt>forget-wid&nbsp;&nbsp; ( wid -- )</tt> </dt>
  <dd> Iterates through the specified wordlist and unlinks all
definitions whose xt addresses are greater than or equal to the value of <tt>HERE</tt>,
the dictionary fill pointer.&nbsp; </dd>

  <dd> Ficl wordlists (2.05 and later) have a name property that can be
assigned. This is used by <tt>ORDER</tt> to list the names of wordlists
in the search order. The name is assumed to be a \0 terminated
string (C style), which conveniently is how Ficl stores word

  <dt> <a name="wid-set-super"></a><tt>wid-set-super&nbsp;&nbsp; ( wid

  <dd> Ficl wordlists have a parent wordlist pointer that is not
specified in standard Forth. Ficl initializes this pointer to NULL
whenever it creates a wordlist, so it ordinarily has no effect.
This word sets the parent pointer to the wordlist specified on the top
of the stack. Ficl's implementation of <tt>SEARCH-WORDLIST</tt> will
chain backward through the parent link of the           wordlist when
searching. This simplifies Ficl's object model in that the search order
does not need to reflect an object's class hierarchy when searching for
a method. It is possible to           implement Ficl object syntax in
strict ANS Forth, but method finders need to manipulate the search order
explicitly. </dd>

<h3> <a name="exuser"></a>User variables </h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <tt>user&nbsp;&nbsp; ( -- ) name</tt> </dt>
  <dd> Create a user variable with the given name. User variables are
virtual machine local. Each VM allocates a fixed amount of storage for
them. You can change the maximum number of user           variables
allowed by defining FICL_USER_CELLS on your compiiler's command line.
Default is 16 user cells. User variables behave like <tt>VARIABLE</tt>s
in all other respects (you use @ and           ! on them, for example).
Example: </dd>

    <dl>

A system shall document the system action taken upon each of the
general or specific ambiguous conditions identified in this Standard.
See 3.4.4 Possible actions on an ambiguous       condition.&nbsp;
<p> The following general ambiguous conditions could occur because of a
combination of factors:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>a name is neither a valid definition name nor a valid number
during text interpretation (3.4 The Forth text interpreter)</b>;&nbsp; </li>
  <li> <br>

followed by " not found".</font> </li>
  <li> <b>a definition name exceeded the maximum length allowed

  <li> <br>
    <font color="#000000">Ficl stores the first 31 characters of the
definition name, and uses all characters of the name in computing its
hash code. The actual length of the name, up to 255
characters, is stored in the definition's length field.</font> </li>
  <li> <b>addressing a region not listed in 3.3.3 Data Space</b>;&nbsp;
 </li>
  <li> <br>
    <font color="#000000">No problem: all addresses in ficl are
absolute. You can reach any 32 bit address in Ficl's address space.</font> </li>
  <li> <b>argument type incompatible with specified input parameter,
e.g., passing a flag to a word expecting an n (3.1 Data types)</b>;&nbsp;</li>
  <li> <br>
    <font color="#000000">Ficl makes no check for argument type
compatibility. Effects of a mismatch vary widely depending on the
specific problem and operands.</font> </li>
  <li> <b>attempting to obtain the execution token, (e.g., with
6.1.0070 ', 6.1.1550 FIND, etc.) of a definition with undefined
interpretation semantics</b>;&nbsp; </li>
  <li> <br>
    <font color="#000000">Ficl returns a valid token, but the result of
executing that token while interpreting may be undesirable.</font> </li>
  <li> <b>dividing by zero (6.1.0100 */, 6.1.0110 */MOD, 6.1.0230 /,
6.1.0240 /MOD, 6.1.1561 FM/MOD, 6.1.1890 MOD, 6.1.2214 SM/REM, 6.1.2370
UM/MOD, 8.6.1.1820 M*/)</b>; </li>
  <li> <br>
    <font color="#000000">Results are target procesor dependent.
Generally, Ficl makes no check for divide-by-zero. The target processor
will probably throw an exception.</font> </li>
  <li> <b>insufficient data-stack space or return-stack space (stack

  <li> <br>
    <font color="#000000">With FICL_ROBUST (sysdep.h) set &gt;= 2, most

dictionary is too full to create a definition header. It checks <tt>ALLOT</tt>
as well, but it is possible to make an unchecked           allocation

  <li> <b>interpreting a word with undefined interpretation semantics</b>;&nbsp;</li>
  <li> <br>
    <font color="#000000">Ficl protects all ANS Forth words with
undefined interpretation semantics from being executed while in

' (tick) and <tt>EXECUTE</tt>, though.</font> </li>
  <li> <b>modifying the contents of the input buffer or a string

  <li> <br>
    <font color="#000000">Varies depending on the nature of the buffer.
The input buffer is supplied by ficl's host function, and may reside in
read-only memory. If so, writing the input           buffer can ganerate
an exception. String literals are stored in the dictionary, and are
writable.</font> </li>
  <li> <b>overflow of a pictured numeric output string</b>; </li>
  <li> <br>
In the unlikely event you are able to construct a pictured numeric
string of more than 255 characters, the system will be corrupted
unpredictably. The buffer area that holds pictured           numeric
output is at the end of the virtual machine. Whatever is mapped after
the offending VM in memory will be trashed, along with the heap
structures that contain it.&nbsp; </li>
  <li> <b>parsed string overflow</b>; </li>
  <li> <br>
Ficl does not copy parsed strings unless asked to. Ordinarily, a string
parsed from the input buffer during normal interpretation is left
in-place, so there is no possibility of overflow.           If you ask
to parse a string into the dictionary, as in <tt>SLITERAL</tt>, you
need to have enough room for the string, otherwise bad things may
happen. This is not usually a problem.&nbsp; </li>

The following specific ambiguous conditions are noted in the glossary
entries of the relevant words:&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li> <b>&gt;IN greater than size of input buffer (3.4.1 Parsing)</b> </li>
  <li> <br>
Bad Things occur - unpredictable bacause the input buffer is supplied
by the host program's outer loop.&nbsp; </li>

  <li> <b>data space containing definitions is de-allocated (3.3.3.2
Contiguous regions)</b> </li>
  <li> <br>
This is OK until the cells are overwritten with something else. The
dictionary maintains a hash table, and the table must be updated in
order to de-allocate words without corruption.&nbsp; </li>
  <li> <b>data space read/write with incorrect alignment (3.3.3.1
Address alignment)</b> </li>
  <li> <br>
Target processor dependent. Consequences include: none (Intel), address
error exception (68K).&nbsp; </li>
  <li> <b>data-space pointer not properly aligned (6.1.0150 ,, 6.1.0860

  <li> <br>

  <li> <br>
Loop initiation words are responsible for checking the stack and
guaranteeing that the control parameters are pushed. Any underflows will
be detected early if FICL_ROBUST is set to two or greater.
Note however that Ficl only checks for return stack underflows at the
end of each line of text.&nbsp; </li>
  <li> <b>most recent definition does not have a name (6.1.1710

  <li> <b>string longer than a counted string returned by 6.1.2450 WORD</b> </li>
  <li> <br>
Ficl stores the first FICL_STRING_MAX-1 chars in the destination
buffer. (The extra character is the trailing space required by the
standard. Yuck.)&nbsp; </li>

  <li> <br>
Depends on target process or and C runtime library implementations of
the &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; operators on unsigned values. For I386, the

Don't. <tt>CREATE</tt> reserves a field in words it builds for <tt>DOES&gt;</tt>to
fill in. If you use <tt>DOES&gt;</tt> on a word not made by <tt>CREATE</tt>,
it will overwrite the first           cell of its parameter area.
That's probably not what you want. Likewise, pictured numeric words
assume that there is a string under construction in the VM's scratch
buffer. If that's not           the case, results may be unpleasant. </li>
</ul>
<h3> Locals Implementation-defined options </h3>
<ul>
  <li> <b>maximum number of locals in a definition (13.3.3 Processing
locals, 13.6.2.1795 LOCALS|)</b> </li>
  <li> <br>
Default is 16. Change by redefining FICL_MAX_LOCALS, defined in
sysdep.h </li>
</ul>
<h3> Locals Ambiguous conditions </h3>
<ul>
  <li> <b>executing a named local while in interpretation state
(13.6.1.0086 (LOCAL))</b> </li>
  <li> <br>
Locals can be found in interpretation state while in the context of a
definition under construction. Under these circumstances, locals behave
correctly. Locals are not visible at all           outside the scope of
a definition.&nbsp; </li>
  <li> <b>name not defined by VALUE or LOCAL (13.6.1.2295 TO)</b> </li>
  <li> <br>
See the CORE ambiguous conditions, above (no change) </li>
</ul>
<h3> Programming Tools Implementation-defined options </h3>
<ul>
  <li> <b>source and format of display by 15.6.1.2194 SEE</b> </li>
  <li> <br>
SEE de-compiles definitions from the dictionary. Because Ficl words are
threaded by their header addresses, it is very straightforward to print
the name and other characteristics of words           in a definition.
Primitives are so noted. Colon definitions are decompiled, but branch
target labels are not reconstructed. Literals and string literals are so
noted, and their contents           displayed. </li>
</ul>
<h3> Search Order Implementation-defined options </h3>
<ul>
  <li> <b>maximum number of word lists in the search order (16.3.3
Finding definition names, 16.6.1.2197 SET-ORDER)</b>&nbsp; </li>
  <li> <br>
Defaults to 16. Can be changed by redefining FICL_DEFAULT_VOCS,
declared in sysdep.h&nbsp; </li>
  <li> <b>minimum search order (16.6.1.2197 SET-ORDER, 16.6.2.1965 ONLY)</b>&nbsp;</li>
  <li> <br>
Equivalent to <tt>FORTH-WORDLIST 1 SET-ORDER</tt> </li>
</ul>
<h3> Search Order Ambiguous conditions </h3>
<ul>
  <li> <b>changing the compilation word list (16.3.3 Finding definition
names)</b> </li>
  <li> <br>
Ficl stores a link to the current definition independently of the
compile wordlist while it is being defined, and links it into the
compile wordlist only after the definition completes
successfully. Changing the compile wordlist mid-definition will cause
the definition to link into the <i>new</i> compile wordlist.&nbsp; </li>
  <li> <b>search order empty (16.6.2.2037 PREVIOUS)</b> </li>
  <li> <br>
Ficl prints an error message if the search order underflows, and resets
the order to its default state.&nbsp; </li>
  <li> <b>too many word lists in search order (16.6.2.0715 ALSO)</b> </li>
  <li> <br>
Ficl prints an error message if the search order overflows, and resets
the order to its default state. </li>
</ul>
